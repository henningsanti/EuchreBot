Notes


ON JUANTI MDP -----------------------------------------------------------

if we are about to play high, we know:
  1. card we will play
  2. "hidden" cards
  3. how many opponents play after us

so, to affirm that we should play our card, we need to have some confidence that we
can beat our opponents that haven't played.

case 1:  1 opponent after us

-     x: our best card
- set O: Opponent hand
- set H: hidden cards
- set W: cards that win against x
- set B: Intersection of sets H and W
- find probability that 1 or more cards in B are in O
